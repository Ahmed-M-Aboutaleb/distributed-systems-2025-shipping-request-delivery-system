# Shipping Request Delivery System

This repository hosts the **Shipping Request and Delivery System** project developed as part of a Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing college course. The project is designed using **Domain Driven Design (DDD)** to ensure a clean separation between the core business logic, infrastructure, and application layers.

## Features

- **Merchant Functionality**
    - **Registration & Login:** Merchants can securely register and log in.
    - **Request Delivery:** Merchants can create delivery requests by entering package details such as size, weight, and destination address.
- **Delivery Personnel Functionality:**
    - **View Assigned Deliveries:** Delivery personnel have access to view the deliveries assigned to them.
    - **Status Updates:** They can update the status of each delivery (e.g., transitioning from 'Picked up' to 'Delivered').
